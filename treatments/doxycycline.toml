# Treatment: doxycycline (sub-antimicrobial MMP inhibitor)
# Literature: Lobmann et al. 2002, Smith et al. 1999
# Mechanism: Zn2+/Ca2+ chelation inhibits MMP activity, preserves collagen/fibronectin

mmp_factor = 1.5                   # 3.0 -> 1.5: 50% reduction of excess MMP
timp_factor = 0.8                  # 0.5 -> 0.8: TIMP balance partially restored

collagen_degradation = 0.0025      # halved: direct consequence of MMP activity reduction
fibronectin_degradation = 0.001    # halved: preserved provisional matrix scaffold
decay = 0.02                       # increased: chelation-based MMP inactivation

cytokine_rate = 0.00115            # 0.0015 -> 0.00115: TACE inhibition reduces TNF-alpha ~25%
