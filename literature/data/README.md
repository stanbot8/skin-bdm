# Validation Reference Data

Validation data (consensus CSVs, raw digitized curves, and SOURCES.yaml) lives in each module under `modules/<module>/data/`. This directory is kept for legacy compatibility. See the [validation README](../README.md) for how to run validation, and each module's README for its specific reference datasets.
